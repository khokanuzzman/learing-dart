// Rules For Creating Variables In Dart
// Variable names are case sensitive, i.e., a and A are different.
// A variable name can consist of letters and alphabets.
// A variable name cannot start with a number.
// Keywords are not allowed to be used as a variable name.
// Blank spaces are not allowed in a variable name.
// Special characters are not allowed except for the underscore (_) and the dollar ($) sign.

// Naming Convention For Variables In Dart
// It is a good habit to follow the naming convention. In Dart Variables, the variable name should start with lower-case, and every second wordâ€™s first letter will be upper-case like num1, fullName, isMarried, etc. Technically, this naming convention is called lowerCamelCase.
